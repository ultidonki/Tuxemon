The WATER REGION mod can be accessed by running the following:
python run_tuxemon.py -s water_end_of_desert.tmx

It has 4 villages, 3 cutscenes, about 20 NPC's to talk to, and by the end of the
game you'll have 5 tuxemon.

It has no trainer battles (apart from one, as part of a cutscene).
It also has no capture devices - you can't catch tuxemon, but you'll get given
some tuxemon at certain story points.
It also has no items, eg. potions - you'll have to use the nurses to heal
(there's quite a lot of them.)

You'll randomly get all your tuxemon levels bumped up at certain story points,
so you won't have to worry about grinding to level up. 
However, the difficulty is balanced so you *should* win, most of the time,
without needing to level up, but sometimes you'll get beaten by an opponent.
(The game doesn't implement any punishments if you lose yet, so the game will
continue as if you'd just won the battle. Just get your tuxemon healed by a
nurse and continue.)
